# Tithify — Nepali Date Windows Taskbar Widget

Tithify is a lightweight, native C++ desktop widget for Windows that beautifully displays the current Nepali (Bikram Sambat) date, specially designed to be viewed directly above your taskbar.

## 🚀 Features

- **Theme Auto-Adapt:** Automatically detects your Windows Light/Dark mode and adjusts its colors and text rendering seamlessly. Reacts to live theme changes instantly without a restart.
- **Auto-Updates:** Built-in update checker uses the GitHub Releases API on a background thread to notify you when a new version is available.
- **Customizable Layout:** Toggle the Day of the Week (Sun, Mon, Tue) next to the Nepali flag directly from the context menu.
- **Zero-Distraction Design:** Frameless, borderless, and perfectly transparent with high-quality GDI+ per-pixel alpha blending.
- **Smart Auto-Hide:** Automatically detects when you're playing games or watching movies in fullscreen and hides itself so it doesn't get in your way.
- **DPI Aware:** Renders crystal-clear text and graphics on high-resolution (4K) monitors without blurriness.
- **Professional Installer:** Comes with a standard Windows Installer (`Setup.exe`) for easy installation, Start Menu shortcuts, and clean uninstalls (no Admin privileges required).
- **System Tray Icon:** Accessible from the system tray with a right-click context menu for quick access to all settings.

## 📅 Interactive Calendar Popup

Click the widget to open a full **Bikram Sambat Calendar** popup — powered by a native GDI+ rendering engine.

- **Month Navigation:** Use the `‹` / `›` buttons or scroll the **mouse wheel** to navigate between months of the current BS year.
- **Dual Date Display:** Every calendar cell shows both the **BS day** (large) and the corresponding **AD date** (small, bottom-right).
- **Today Highlight:** The current day is highlighted in crimson red for instant recognition.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Use **Arrow Keys** to move between days, **Home** to jump to today, and **Escape** to close.
- **Bilingual Header:** Month name displayed in both English and Devanagari script, e.g., `Baisakh 2082 • बैशाख २०८२`.
- **Gregorian Range:** Shows the full Gregorian (AD) date range for the displayed BS month.
- **Public Holiday & Saturday Indicators:** Saturdays and public holidays are highlighted in red; festival/event days show a colored dot indicator.

## 🎉 Holiday & Festival Engine

The calendar automatically fetches and displays Nepali public holidays and cultural events for the current BS year.

- **Online Auto-Fetch:** On first launch, holiday data is downloaded from GitHub (with jsDelivr CDN as a fallback) in a background thread — the UI never freezes.
- **Smart Local Cache:** Downloaded holidays are saved in an XOR-encoded binary `.dat` file under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Tithify\` so they load instantly on every subsequent launch.
- **Event Flyout Panel:** Clicking on any day with an event shows a speech-bubble flyout with:
  - Full Nepali (Devanagari) and English event title
  - Event category badge (e.g., **PUBLIC HOLIDAY**, **FESTIVAL / पर्व**)
  - A detailed event description
- **Offline Mode:** If no internet is available, the calendar shows an **⚠ OFFLINE** notice with a **↻ Retry** button to re-attempt fetching when back online.
- **BS Year Coverage:** Full calendar data from **BS 1975 to 2100**.

## ⚡ Ultra-Efficient Resource Management

This widget is engineered from the ground up to consume absolutely minimal system resources (essentially 0.00% CPU usage and a tiny RAM footprint).

**How it achieves this:**
Instead of constantly running complex date conversion algorithms, the widget uses an ultra-efficient caching technique:
1. Every second, it asks the Windows OS for the current Gregorian (AD) Date — a nearly zero-cost operation.
2. It checks if the Day, Month, or Year has changed since the last frame.
3. Only if the day has physically changed (which happens exactly once a day at 12:00 AM) will the widget perform the Bikram Sambat conversion logic and re-render the text.
4. For the other 86,399 seconds of the day, it skips all math entirely and just paints the cached text to the screen!

This ensures you have a perfectly accurate, real-time widget that doesn't drain your laptop's battery or steal CPU cycles from your games.

## 🛠️ How It Works

The widget uses the native Windows Win32 API and GDI+ to render directly to your screen:
- **Z-Order Enforcement:** It uses a 250ms background timer to assert its `HWND_TOPMOST` status, preventing Windows from hiding it behind other windows.
- **Taskbar Previews:** It aggressively intercepts the `WM_SHOWWINDOW` API call to veto `SW_PARENTCLOSING` requests, stopping the Windows Taskbar thumbnail system from accidentally hiding it when you hover over open apps.
- **Native BS Conversion:** The entire Bikram Sambat (1975–2100) calendar mapping is embedded directly into the C++ binary. This guarantees offline date display out-of-the-box.
- **WinHTTP API:** Update checks and holiday fetching are performed safely on detached background threads using native Windows networking to ensure the UI never stutters.
- **Live Theme Sync:** Listens for `WM_SETTINGCHANGE` (ImmersiveColorSet) to detect and apply Windows theme changes in real-time.
